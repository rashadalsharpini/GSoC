**MDAnalysis** is an object-oriented Python library to analyze trajectories from molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in [many popular formats](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/documentation_pages/coordinates/init.html#id1). It can write most of these formats, too, together with [atom selections](https://docs.mdanalysis.org/documentation_pages/selections_modules.html#selection-exporters) suitable for visualization or native analysis tools.

[GSoC MDAnalysis](https://github.com/MDAnalysis/mdanalysis/wiki/GSoC-2024-Project-Ideas)
#### Technologies
python, cython and c/c++
#### prerequisites
MDAnalysis is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. **Therefore**, our GSoC projects require a basic knowledge and hands-on **experience of molecular dynamics simulations and the associated analyses, or equivalent experience in simulations and modeling of molecular systems (physics, biophysics, chemistry, or materials).** For our suggested projects, please check carefully the project descriptions to see the associated desirable skills.
